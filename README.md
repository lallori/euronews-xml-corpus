# euronewsproject xml corpus 


This set of scripts is used to create an xml corpus that will be used for data analytics.
It gets the the Euronews project (https://www.euronewsproject.org/) data from the MIA database (https://www.medici.org/the-medici-interactive-archive-mia/). 


Test scenarios:

1) The 1600 Experiment

Dealing with over 200 volumes of archival material, containing many thousands of pages, is no simple matter!  Therefore to test our methods and arrive at some preliminary conclusions, not only about the nature of our documents but also about the best ways to analyze them, we have taken a full year of complete texts and created a corpus using XML.  This we are submitting to a number of procedures using a variety of tools, the results of which will be published for further reference of our team and interested scholars as well as the general public.
